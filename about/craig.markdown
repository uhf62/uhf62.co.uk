Hi, I'm Craig Andersonâ€”a web developer specialising in Python and Django.

I've been working in web development for over 18 years, during which time I've worked with all sorts of companies and organisations including:

 * the [Australian Broadcasting Corporation](http://www.abc.net.au);
 * [headspace](http://headspace.org.au), the Australian government's youth mental health foundation;
 * [SitePoint](http://sitepoint.com), a publisher of resources for web professionals (and, back in the day, [something of a startup incubator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SitePoint#History));
 * [Telstra](http://telstra.com.au), Australia's largest telecommunications company; and
 * [Ten Group](http://tengroup.com), provider of concierge services to customers of some of the world's leading financial institutions.
