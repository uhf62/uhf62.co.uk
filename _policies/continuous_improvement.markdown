UHF 62 strives to get better at everything we do.

## Continuous Improvement of Technical Skills

We'll participate in code reviews. These are a great way to expose yourself to different styles, techniques and functionality that you may have forgotten or be ignorant of.

We'll attend meet-ups, talks and conferences.

When they arise, we'll take opportunities to learn about new approaches and different languages.

## Continuous Improvement of Policies

Our policies are not set in stone and are subject to change.

The director of UHF 62 will try to meet and get to know like-minded people, develop meaningful relationships with them, learn from them, and feed the things we learn back into these policies.
