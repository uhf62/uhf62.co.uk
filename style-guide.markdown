## General Rules

Titles are in title case.

When in doubt, compare options using [Google's Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=backend%2Cback+end&year_start=2000&year_end=2019).

## Preferred Spellings

* back end, not backend or back-end
* front end, not frontend or front-end
* website, not web site or web-site
