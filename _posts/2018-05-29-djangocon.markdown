I'm back from [DjangoCon Europe 2018](https://2018.djangocon.eu), my first open-source developers' conference. It was really exciting to be surrounded by so many clever people sharing great ideas. I learned a lot, but perhaps the most important thing I learned was [*how* to attend an open-source conference]({% post_url 2018-06-18-open-source-conference-advice %}).

Of the talks that I saw, my personal highlights were:

 * [Growing old gracefully: on being a career programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WUFWmyk-HY) by Carlton Gibson, a mix of points which resonated with me strongly (Yes! Self-care is incredibly important! No! Good developers don't stop being good developers after thirty!), great advice, and encouragement to be prolific.
 * [Writing code? Pfftâ€¦ evolve it instead!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=973NUf3skYM) by Emma Gordon which was a very interesting practical demonstration on how genetic algorithms can be used to write code using [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
 * [It's not a bug, it's a bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZddeZ2RiLE) by Anna-Livia Gomart, a great reminder to always keep your own biases and [falsehoods you believe](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) in mind.
 * [Creating solid APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pgQXzoUcgk) by Rivo Laks offered some good advice for designing APIs, and taught me that [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org) is a thing I should be aware of and probably make use of.

There were *so* many talks I missed, and I hope to find some time to go back through [the extensive recordings which are now available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/djangoconeurope/videos).

Other highlights were:

 * Django really is a community, and I'm keen to get involved. I already have [an open source contribution policy](/policies/open_source), but I'm hoping to improve that to make more of a contribution.
 * The measures the conference took to be as inclusive as possible were amazing. They had preferred pronoun badges!
